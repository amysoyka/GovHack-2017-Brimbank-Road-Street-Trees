# GovHack-2017-Brimbank-Road-Street-Trees

As a member of the State Operations Team - I supported my local GovHack node by demonstrating potential uses for the available datasets.
I also developed my own side-project during the event, as a way of demonstrating the usefulness of 3D Printing for visualising Mapping & Graphical data.

Datasets used:

Brimbank Road Network

Brimbank Street Trees
